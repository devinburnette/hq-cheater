## About

This python script predicts HQ answers by Googling the question and seeing which of the answers show up most in Google's 1st page of search results. It gets the text by using Google Chrome's Speech Recognition Webkit API and then builds the Google Query from there. Since Google now only allows a single domain for their Search API, I'm using Selenium Webdriver to get a real browser to Google with.

Warning: This is not a perfect science and your mileage may vary. Selenium makes things slower.

## Disclaimers

This website is NOT to be used during a live game. This would be really cheating, against HQ's rules, and morally irresponsible. Don't do it!
